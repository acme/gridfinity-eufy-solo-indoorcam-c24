[Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz/) is a modular, open-source grid storage system for your workshop that lets you display your tools and parts for quick access and retrieval. It consists of a gridded baseplate that can hold bins of different sizes and shapes.

The [Eufy Solo IndoorCam C24](https://us.eufy.com/products/t84001w1) is a cheap home security camera that supports voice assistants and has a night vision mode.

This project combines the two to let you easily stack an IndoorCam C24 on top of a Gridfinity bin. It's perfect for positioning your camera to monitor your magical 3D printer.
